          Fueled by a commitment to lifelong learning, I have found a love for the ever-evolving world of software. For me, programming sits at the intersection of of creativity, methodical thinking, and steep-learning curves, providing the perfect challenge. Whether it's building custom solutions or diving into new frameworks, each obstacle gives a new opportunity to innovate.

        <h3> Background </h3>
        <p>
          Hello! I am Leon, an enthusiastic career changer with three years experience in supply chain, geering up to focus my expertise and data background into development. In my career so far, I have discovered the key to my professional fulfillment is continuous learning. When I first encountered programming, using R for statistical analysis in my Economics degree, I spent hours beyond the scope of the course creating descriptive statistics visuals. The ability to translate intricate information into digestible material opened the gateway for my love of code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast forward to my career in supply chain, I began with data analytics using DAX and SQL and three years later ended up building my first custom platform for internal use. Over the following 4 months I developed three platforms and began collaborating with other business functions across sales, finance and operations to support their diverse needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having little resources and relying heavily on my own curiosity and research ability was energising and ultimately ignited my move into software engineering. Landing me where I am today, with 450+ hours of coding under my belt and a BCS-accredited certificate in Web Development with AI, I am excited to focus my unique operational perspective into a dynamic development team where I can continue learning and have an impact.
